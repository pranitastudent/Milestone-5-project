[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pranitastudent/Milestone-5-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pranitastudent/Milestone-5-project)

## Project Entrails

<p> An eccomerce site will be built which will sell t-shirts for men, women and children. The user should be able to filter the t-shirts using the options: men, women and children. In order to buy the t-shirts the user will have to register with a username and password and login. The registration and username will be
a secure application using the authentication process. The user will navigate through the site using a navbar  through : Home, Cart, Login and Register.  The user once logged in can pay for the item using the strip authentication system. Logged in users are able to leave feedback for the site interms of 'likes' and a feedback review on the item purchased.
Logged in users can only edit there own feedback. Users will not be able to delete items from the website or delete reviews from other users. Git and GitHub will be used for version control. The final site will be deployed and hosted on Heroku.</p>

## UX Design - User Experience
<br>

<p> The user regardless of being logged in should be able to view all t-shirts , each with a price indicated and quantity to add to cart. The user should be able to register and login in securely using the authentication process. The user will have a limit of maxiumum 999 products to add to the cart. The user is able to view the item in the cart but must be registered and logged
in to pay for the item using the stripe payment system. The logged in user is able to leave reviews about a particular product, edit there review and delete there own review. Non-registered users are unable to leave a review for a product.
